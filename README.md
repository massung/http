# HTTP Package for LispWorks

The `http` package is a dead-simple package used for performing simple HTTP requests and parsing the responses. It also can parse URLs, escape and unescape strings, and parse query strings.

It makes heavy use of my [`re`](http://github.com/massung/re) and [`lexer`](http://www.github.com/massung/lexer) packages, so to understand some of the code you should start with those. But it really is simple. It also uses my [`base64`](http://github.com/massung/base64) package.

## Quickstart

After loading the package, the first step is to parse a URL.

	CL-USER > (parse-url "www.google.com")
	#<URL HTTP "www.google.com" "/">
	
Once you have a URL, you can create a `request` object.

	CL-USER > (make-instance 'request :url *)
	#<REQUEST GET HTTP "www.google.com" "/">
	
Finally, `http-perform` will open a socket, issue the request to the server, and return a `response` object.

	CL-USER > (http-perform *)
	#<RESPONSE 200 "OK">

	CL-USER > (response-body *)
	"<!doctype html><html>...</html>"

## Following Redirects

Following a redirect is simply a matter of fetching the "Location" header in the response, creating a new request with the new URL, and then calling `http-perform` with the new request. The `http-follow` function takes a response object (and an optional `:limit` for the number of hops to take) and does just that.

	CL-USER > (http-get "google.com")
	#<RESPONSE 301 "Moved Permanently">
	
	CL-USER > (http-follow * :limit 1)
	#<RESPONSE 200 "OK">

*NOTE: If the response doesn't contain a new "Location" to follow, an error is signaled.*

## Handling Encoded Content

By default, the `http` package won't send an "Accept-Encoding" header with your request. Without this, a server shouldn't send an encoded body. You can, however, send the header yourself, and then decode the body after you have received a response.

	CL-USER > (http-get "httpbin.org/gzip" :headers '(("Accept-Encoding" "gzip")))
	#<RESPONSE 200 OK>

Now, assuming you have a function `gzip:unzip`, you can decode the body with something like this:

	CL-USER > (with-headers ((encoding "Content-Encoding" :if-not-found "identity"))
	              (response-headers *)
	            (let ((decoder (cond
	                            ((string= encoding "identity") #'identity)
	                            ((string= encoding "gzip") #'gzip:unzip)
	                            (t
	                             (error "Unknown Content-Encoding: ~a" encoding)))))
	              (funcall decoder (response-body *))))

*NOTE: At some point the "gzip" encoding will be added to the `http` package and this will be done for you.*

## Constructing URLs

While the `url` class is exported, and you are certainly free to `(make-instance 'url ...)`, the `with-url` macro can be extremely helpful.

	(with-url ((url url-form &rest initargs) &body body)

The `url-form` can be either another `url` object or a string to be parsed with `parse-url`. After `url-form` is evaluated, if you passed any `initargs`, they will be used to override the various initargs before being bound to the `url` variable.

	CL-USER > (with-url (url "apple.com" :path "/trailers") url)
	#<URL "http://apple.com/trailers">

	CL-USER > (with-url (url * :scheme :https :auth '("my" "password")) url)
	#<URL "https://my:password@apple.com/trailers">

This is extremely handy.

*NOTE: The `parse-url` function also takes these `initargs` as well, allowing you to override whatever was parsed!*

## Even Quicker?

While that was an overview of what's going on under-the-hood, those three steps are wrapped up nicely in the following helper functions:

	(http-head url &key headers)
	(http-get url &key headers)
	(http-delete url &key headers)
	(http-put url &key headers data)
	(http-post url &key headers data)
	(http-patch url &key headers data)

Each of these functions use the `with-url` macro, allowing you to pass either a `url` object or a string.

The optional `headers` should be an associative list of key/value strings that will be sent with the request. 

*NOTE: `http-perform` already takes care of any obvious headers that will need to be sent: Host, Connection, Content-Length, and Authorization.*

PUT, POST, and PATCH requests have an optional `data` argument, which is what is sent in the body of the request. *At this time there is no support for multi-part posts*.

## Additional Utility Functions

The `http` package also comes with quite a few helper functions to assist you in generating requests and handling responses.

The `encode-url` function takes a string and makes sure that all characters are properly encoded for the query string of a URL.

	CL-USER > (encode-url "$9.50+/-5 cents")
	"%249.50%2B%2F-5+cents"

The inverse is `decode-url`, which given an encoded string will decode it into the original value.

	CL-USER > (decode-url *)
	"$9.50+/-5 cents"
	
The `make-query-string` function takes an list of key/value pairs and generates a url-encoded query string. This function is used internally for all URL query strings, but you can use it for PUT and POST request bodies.

	CL-USER > (make-query-string '(("q" "henry gale") ("limit" 10)))
	"q=henry+gale&limit=10"

The inverse of `make-query-string` is `parse-query-string`. Given a query string, it will parse it into a list of key/value pairs.

	CL-USER > (parse-query-string *)
	(("q" "henry gale") ("limit" "10"))
	
*NOTE: While `make-query-string` takes any value and converts it to a string, `parse-query-string` will only return strings for values as it is unaware of the type. It's up to you to parse the value appropriately.*

The `encode-html` and `decode-html` can be used to replace unicode characters in a string.

	CL-USER > (encode-html "<this>")
	"&lt;this&gt;"

	CL-USER > (decode-html "This &mdash; That")
	"This â€” That"

The macro `with-headers` is very useful in parsing response (and request) headers and binding keys to values.

	CL-USER > (http-get "www.microsoft.com")
	#<RESPONSE 200 "OK">

	CL-USER > (with-headers ((server "Server" :if-not-found "unknown")
	                         (content-length "Content-Length"))
	              (response-headers *)
	            (list content-length server))
	("1020" "Microsoft-IIS/8.0")

*NOTE: The `:if-not-found` optional argument defaults to `nil`. It is lazily evaluated, so it's the perfect place to signal an `error` if you want to ensure that a particular header exists.*
